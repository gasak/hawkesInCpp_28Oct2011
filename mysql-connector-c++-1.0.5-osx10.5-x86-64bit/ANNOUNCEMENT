Dear MySQL Users,

the first GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.0.5 GA. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for connecting client applications to the MySQL Server 5.1 or newer. You can download the production release at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.0.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC 4.0. We use the MySQL Connector/C++ in two of our own products. A development version of MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since months. MySQL Connector/OpenOffice.org, an OpenOffice.org 3.1 extension, is a thin wrapper around the MySQL driver for C++.

We have improved the driver and added a couple of new features since the last beta release. Please see the documentation and the CHANGES file in the source distribution for a detailed description of bugs that have been fixed. The following features have been added:

 - Introduced unbuffered fetch for Statement. (Andrey)
 - Improved the memory management to not leak in exceptional situations. (Andrey)
 - ConnectionMetaData, ResultSetMetaData, ParameterMetaData now allow
   statements like: connection->getMetaData->getSchema(). (Lawrin, Andrey)
 - Added SunConnect support to MSI installer. (Iggy, Lawrin)
 - Added "defaultStatementResultType" to MySQL_Connection::setClientOption(). (Andrey)
 - Added Result::getType() to the three result set classes. (Andrey)
 - Added better support for named pipes, on Windows. (Andrey)
 - Fixed a bug in MySQL_Connection::setSessionVariable(). (Andrey)
 - Fixed the interface of sql::Driver and sql::Connection
   so they accept the options map by alias instead of by value. (Andrey)
